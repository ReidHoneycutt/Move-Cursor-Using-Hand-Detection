# Move-Cursor-Using-Hand-Detection

This program implements a simple way (without using sockets) to affect the mouse position. Firstly it uses cvzone and mediapipe for the hand tracking. Then it uses the library pyautogui to change the position of the mouse. Once the python program is running, the visual is done using p5.js to draw ellipses to the cursor positions.
